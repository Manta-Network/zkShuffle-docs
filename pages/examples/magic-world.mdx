- The initial shield of joiner is 10.
- When the game starts, each player randomly draws 10 out of 30 cards, composed by 10 Wizards, 10 Warriors, and 10 Tanks.
- During the game, players take turns to show cards where each card has two attributes: attack and defense. Attack will cause damage to the opponent player, defense will provide a one-time shield for player.
- The game will last for ten rounds. When the player's health drops to 0, the player loses. If none of the players' health drop to 0, the game ended in a draw.
