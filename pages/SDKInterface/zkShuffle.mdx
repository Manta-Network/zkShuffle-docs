# Tourial Step-by-Step

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
Suppose there is a simple game zkhilo, already [created](https://github.com/Poseidon-ZKP/Poseidon-ZKP/blob/90f2088c1e2e73fd4852ec30081a41df0f57e1b3/packages/contracts/tests/e2e.ts#L68) on-chain, two players each have 1 card in hand for bet, player who have the big card win the game. complete logic as below:

    ```ts
        zkHiLo Game Logic :
        1. deal card 0 to player 0
        2. deal card 1 to player 1
        3. bet
        4. player 0 open card 0
        5. player 1 open card 1
        6. win/lose
    ```

- **step 1** : create zkShuffle instance, with given shuffleManager contract address, and player signer

  ```ts
  const player = await zkShuffle.create(ShuffleManagerContract, signer);
  ```

- **step 2** : join the game

  ```ts
  const playerIdx = await player.joinGame(gameId);
  ```

- **step 3** : check player's turn in the game

  ```ts
  const turn = await player.checkTurn(gameId);
  ```

- **step 4.1** : if it's player's shuffle turn, shuffle the card

  ```ts
  await player.shuffle(gameId);
  ```

- **step 4.2** : if it's player's deal turn, draw the card

  ```ts
  await player.draw(gameId);
  ```

- **step 4.3** : if it's player's open turn, open the card

  ```ts
      const cards[] = await player.open(gameId, cardIds)
  ```

- **Demo** :

  ```ts
  // create zkShuffle instance
  const player = await zkShuffle.create(SM, owner);

  // join game
  const playerIdx = await player.joinGame(gameId);

  // play game
  let turn;
  while (turn != GameTurn.Complete) {
    turn = await player.checkTurn(gameId);

    if (turn != NOP) {
      switch (turn) {
        case GameTurn.Shuffle:
          await player.shuffle(gameId);
          break;
        case GameTurn.Deal:
          await player.draw(gameId);
          break;
        case GameTurn.Open:
          const cards = await player.open(gameId, cardIds);
          break;
        case GameTurn.Complete:
          break;
        case GameTurn.Error:
          break;
        default:
          console.log('err turn ', turn);
          exit(-1);
      }
    }
  }
  ```
